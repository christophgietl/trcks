# trcks ðŸš‚

`trcks` is a Python library.
It allows
[railway-oriented programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/)
in two different programming styles:

1. an *object-oriented style* based on method chaining and
2. a *functional style* based on function composition.

## Motivation

The following subsections motivate
railway-oriented programming in general and
the `trcks` library in particular.

### Why should I use railway-oriented programming?

When writing modular Python code,
return type annotations are extremely helpful.
They help humans
(and maybe [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Large_language_model&oldid=1283157830))
to understand the purpose of a function.
And they allow static type checkers (e.g. `mypy` or `pyright`)
to check whether functions fit together:

```pycon
>>> def get_user_id(user_email: str) -> int:
...     if user_email == "erika.mustermann@domain.org":
...         return 1
...     if user_email == "john_doe@provider.com":
...         return 2
...     raise Exception("User does not exist")
...
>>> def get_subscription_id(user_id: int) -> int:
...     if user_id == 1:
...         return 42
...     raise Exception("User does not have a subscription")
...
>>> def get_subscription_fee(subscription_id: int) -> float:
...     return subscription_id * 0.1
...
>>> def get_subscription_fee_by_email(user_email: str) -> float:
...     return get_subscription_fee(get_subscription_id(get_user_id(user_email)))
...
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("erika.mustermann@domain.org")
4.2

```

Unfortunately, conventional return type annotations do not always tell the full story:

```pycon
>>> get_subscription_id(user_id=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
Exception: User does not have a subscription

```

We can document domain exceptions in the docstring of the function:

```pycon
>>> def get_subscription_id(user_id: int) -> int:
...     """Look up the subscription ID for a user.
...
...     Raises:
...         Exception: If the user does not have a subscription.
...     """
...     if user_id == 1:
...         return 42
...     raise Exception("User does not have a subscription")
...

```

While this helps humans (and maybe LLMs),
static type checkers usually ignore docstrings.
Moreover, it is difficult
to document all domain exceptions in the docstring and
to keep this documentation up-to-date.
Therefore, we should use railway-oriented programming.

### How can I use railway-oriented programming?

Instead of raising exceptions (and documenting this behavior in the docstring),
we return a `Result` type:

```pycon
>>> from typing import Literal
>>> from trcks import Result
>>>
>>> UserDoesNotHaveASubscription = Literal["User does not have a subscription"]
>>>
>>> def get_subscription_id(
...     user_id: int
... ) -> Result[UserDoesNotHaveASubscription, int]:
...     if user_id == 1:
...         return "success", 42
...     return "failure", "User does not have a subscription"
...
>>> get_subscription_id(user_id=1)
('success', 42)
>>> get_subscription_id(user_id=2)
('failure', 'User does not have a subscription')

```

This return type

1. describes the success case *and* the failure case and
2. is verified by static type checkers.

### What do I need for railway-oriented programming?

Combining `Result`-returning functions
with other `Result`-returning functions or with "regular" functions
can be cumbersome.
Moreover, it can lead to repetitive code patterns:

```pycon
>>> from typing import Union
>>>
>>> UserDoesNotExist = Literal["User does not exist"]
>>> FailureDescription = Union[UserDoesNotExist, UserDoesNotHaveASubscription]
>>>
>>> def get_user_id(user_email: str) -> Result[UserDoesNotExist, int]:
...     if user_email == "erika.mustermann@domain.org":
...         return "success", 1
...     if user_email == "john_doe@provider.com":
...         return "success", 2
...     return "failure", "User does not exist"
...
>>> def get_subscription_fee_by_email(
...     user_email: str
... ) -> Result[FailureDescription, float]:
...     # Apply get_user_id:
...     user_id_result = get_user_id(user_email)
...     if user_id_result[0] == "failure":
...         return user_id_result
...     user_id = user_id_result[1]
...     # Apply get_subscription_id:
...     subscription_id_result = get_subscription_id(user_id)
...     if subscription_id_result[0] == "failure":
...         return subscription_id_result
...     subscription_id = subscription_id_result[1]
...     # Apply get_subscription_fee:
...     subscription_fee = get_subscription_fee(subscription_id)
...     # Return result:
...     return "success", subscription_fee
...
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("erika.mustermann@domain.org")
('success', 4.2)
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("john_doe@provider.com")
('failure', 'User does not have a subscription')
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("jane_doe@provider.com")
('failure', 'User does not exist')

```

Therefore, we need a library that helps us combine functions.

### How does the module `trcks.oop` help with function combination?

The module `trcks.oop` supports combining functions in an object-oriented style
using method chaining:

```pycon
>>> from trcks.oop import Wrapper
>>>
>>> def get_subscription_fee_by_email(
...     user_email: str
... ) -> Result[FailureDescription, float]:
...     return (
...         Wrapper(core=user_email)
...         .map_to_result(get_user_id)
...         .map_success_to_result(get_subscription_id)
...         .map_success(get_subscription_fee)
...         .core
...     )
...
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("erika.mustermann@domain.org")
('success', 4.2)
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("john_doe@provider.com")
('failure', 'User does not have a subscription')
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("jane_doe@provider.com")
('failure', 'User does not exist')

```

### How does the package `trcks.fp` help with function combination?

The package `trcks.fp` supports combining functions in a functional style
using function composition:

```pycon
>>> from trcks.fp.composition import Pipeline3, pipe
>>> from trcks.fp.monads import result as r
>>>
>>> def get_subscription_fee_by_email(
...     user_email: str
... ) -> Result[FailureDescription, float]:
...     # If your static type checker cannot infer
...     # the type of the argument passed to `pipe`,
...     # explicit type assignment can help:
...     pipeline: Pipeline3[
...         str,
...         Result[UserDoesNotExist, int],
...         Result[FailureDescription, int],
...         Result[FailureDescription, float],
...     ] = (
...         user_email,
...         get_user_id,
...         r.map_success_to_result(get_subscription_id),
...         r.map_success(get_subscription_fee),
...     )
...     return pipe(pipeline)
...
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("erika.mustermann@domain.org")
('success', 4.2)
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("john_doe@provider.com")
('failure', 'User does not have a subscription')
>>> get_subscription_fee_by_email("jane_doe@provider.com")
('failure', 'User does not exist')

```

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

This section answers some questions that might come to your mind.

### Where can I learn more about railway-oriented programming?

Scott Wlaschin's blog post
[Railway oriented programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/)
comes with lots of examples and illustrations as well as
videos and slides from his talks.

### Should I replace all raised exceptions with `trcks.Result`?

No, you should not.
Scott Wlaschin's blog post
[Against Railway-Oriented Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/against-railway-oriented-programming/)
lists eight scenarios
where raising or not catching an exception is the better choice.

### Which static type checkers does `trcks` support?

`trcks` is compatible with current versions of `mypy` and `pyright`.
Other type checkers may work as well.

### Which alternatives to `trcks` are there?

[returns](https://pypi.org/project/returns/) supports
object-oriented style and functional style (like `trcks`).
It provides
a `Result` container (and multiple other containers) for synchronous code and
a `Future` and a `FutureResult` container for asynchronous code.
Whereas the `Result` container is pretty similar to `trcks.Result`,
the `Future` container and the `FutureResult` container deviate
from `collections.abc.Awaitable` and `trcks.AwaitableResult`.
Other major differences are:

- `returns` provides
  [do notation](https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/0.25.0/pages/do-notation.html)
  and
  [dependency injection](https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/0.25.0/pages/context.html).
- The authors of `returns`
  [recommend using `mypy`](https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/0.25.0/pages/quickstart.html#typechecking-and-other-integrations)
  along with
  [their suggested `mypy` configuration](https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/0.25.0/pages/contrib/mypy_plugins.html#configuration)
  and
  [their custom `mypy` plugin](https://returns.readthedocs.io/en/0.25.0/pages/contrib/mypy_plugins.html#mypy-plugin).

[Expression](https://pypi.org/project/Expression/) supports
object-oriented style ("fluent syntax") and
functional style (like `trcks`).
It provides a `Result` class (and multiple other container classes)
for synchronous code.
The `Result` class is pretty similar to `trcks.Result` and `trcks.oop.ResultWrapper`.
An `AsyncResult` type based on `collections.abc.AsyncGenerator`
[will be added in a future version](https://github.com/dbrattli/Expression/pull/247).

### Which libraries inspired `trcks`?

`trcks` is mostly inspired
by the Python libraries mentioned in the previous section and
by the TypeScript library [fp-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fp-ts).
